//
// HubStore.swift — resolving pinned Hugging Face repositories into a local directory.
//
// This repository distributes no weights and no bundles (SECURITY.md); it downloads
// them. Two repositories are involved and they are not interchangeable:
//
//   * the Core AI bundles, converted and published by this project, and
//   * Kyutai's checkpoint, which owns `model.safetensors`, the sentencepiece model and
//     the per-voice embeddings, under CC-BY-4.0. Those weights stay upstream's.
//
// Both are pinned to an immutable revision rather than a branch, which is the whole of
// the integrity story SECURITY.md claims: a later push to either repository cannot
// change what a pinned consumer receives. What is new here is that the Hub reports a
// SHA-256 for every LFS-stored file, so a download can be checked against it on the way
// in rather than trusted.
//
// No third-party dependencies: URLSession for transport, CryptoKit for the digest.
//
// This file is duplicated in parakeet-swift rather than shared. Neither host depends on
// the other and each pins its own repositories, so a package for ~300 lines would
// couple two ports that have no other reason to move together. If a third port
// appears, that trade changes — keep the two copies in step until then.
//
